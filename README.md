# Intelligent Document Processing System

A sophisticated document processing system that leverages machine learning to automatically analyze, classify, and extract information from business documents. This project aims to streamline document workflows by providing intelligent automation for document understanding.

## Project Overview

Our system transforms the way organizations handle documents by providing:

- Automated document classification to identify different types of business documents
- Intelligent information extraction from various document formats
- A robust API for seamless integration with existing systems
- Scalable processing pipeline for handling large document volumes

## System Architecture

Our document processing pipeline follows these key steps:

1. Document Input: The system accepts various document formats (PDF, images) through a REST API
2. Preprocessing: Documents undergo initial processing including format validation and conversion
3. Analysis: Machine learning models analyze the document content and structure
4. Information Extraction: Key information is identified and extracted based on document type
5. Result Delivery: Processed information is returned in a structured format

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Visual Studio Code (recommended IDE)
- Windows OS (support for other operating systems coming soon)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd intelligent-doc-processor
